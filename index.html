                            <p>To make Gulab Jamun, first prepare a sugar syrup by boiling sugar, water, cardamom, and rose water until slightly sticky. Next, create a soft, crack-free dough by combining milk solids (khoya or milk powder), a small amount of all-purpose flour, baking powder, and ghee, kneading gently with a little milk. Form small, smooth balls from the dough, then deep-fry them slowly in hot oil or ghee until golden brown. Finally, immediately transfer the warm, fried jamuns into the prepared warm sugar syrup and let them soak for several hours, allowing them to absorb the sweetness and become soft and plump.</p>

                            <p>To make Rasmalai, first curdle full-fat milk with lemon juice or vinegar to create chenna. Drain and knead the chenna until smooth, then form small, flattened discs. Boil these discs in a light sugar syrup until they swell and become spongy. Simultaneously, prepare the malai by simmering milk with sugar, saffron, and cardamom until it thickens slightly. Gently squeeze the excess syrup from the cooked chenna discs and transfer them into the warm, sweetened milk. Let them soak for a few hours, ideally chilling them, allowing the discs to absorb the rich, flavored milk before serving, garnished with nuts.</p>

                            <p>To make Soan Papdi, first prepare a sugar syrup by boiling sugar and water until it reaches a brittle, hard-ball consistency. In parallel, roast a mixture of besan and all-purpose flour in ample ghee until golden and fragrant. Once the sugar syrup is ready, pour it onto a clean, greased surface and allow it to cool slightly. Then, add the roasted flour mixture to the semi-cooled syrup and, using a metal scraper or your hands (once cool enough), continuously fold and pull the mixture to create fine, thread-like layers. Once flaky, press it into a greased tray, flatten, and cut into squares before it completely sets.</p>

                            <p>To make Gajar Ka Halwa, begin by grating fresh carrots. In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, sauté the grated carrots in ghee for a few minutes until slightly softened. Next, add full-fat milk and continue to cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until all the milk has been absorbed and evaporated. Then, stir in sugar and cook until it dissolves and the mixture thickens. For a richer taste, add khoya (milk solids) and cook for a few more minutes. Finally, mix in cardamom powder and garnish with roasted nuts and raisins before serving warm.</p>

                            <p>To make Black Gulab Jamun, first prepare a sugar syrup infused with cardamom and rose water. For the jamuns, create a soft, crack-free dough using milk solids (khoya or milk powder), a small amount of all-purpose flour, baking powder, and ghee, kneading gently with milk. Form small, smooth balls from the dough. The crucial step for the "black" color is to deep-fry these balls slowly over a low to medium flame for a longer duration than regular gulab jamuns, allowing them to turn a deep, almost blackish-brown and develop a slightly crusty exterior. Once fried, immediately transfer the hot jamuns into the prepared warm sugar syrup and let them soak for several hours until they swell and become juicy.</p>
